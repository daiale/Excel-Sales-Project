# Excel-Sales-Project
I created a Bike Sales Dashboard,a project provided and guided by Alex Freburg, to analyze sales trends by income, region, age, and commute distance. Starting with a provided dataset, I cleaned and transformed the data, ensuring accuracy. I then was able to create a dashboard in  excel using pivot tables. The main point of the dashboard for Bike Sales is to show what groups of people are buying bikes and how that data can be used by the company to dertermine marketing strategies, like what demograohic to market to, along with how companies can imporve there sales, for example, based on regions or more!

Skills Gained:

Demographic Analysis: The dashboard allows users to explore bike sales patterns based on gender, region, age, and commute distance.
Filtering Options: Users can customize their analysis by filtering based on marital status and degrees.
User-Friendly Interface: The dashboard presents data through charts and interactive elements for easy navigation.
Excel Proficiency: This project enhanced my Excel and pivot table skills, laying a foundation for more advanced data analysis tools like Power BI.

Key Insights:
Most bike purchases were made by single men in the North American region.
The Europe region has a ratioed amount of 75:73, based on the purchase amount ofsingle to married people who purchase bikes.
A commute distance 10+ miles is more common for adolescent, while most middle aged people commute 5-10 miles and older even less.

This project was a learning experience, beginning with a provided dataset and guidance. It marked a milestone in my journey towards data-driven decision-making, and it's just the start of my exploration into the world of data analysis.
